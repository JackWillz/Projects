Jack J Williams Portfolio

Contains publicly available projects that I have been working on. No project/data contains sensitive information.

Note that some of these projects were created at the start of my Python career and will not reflect my current coding standards!

A private directory is available that contains the productionised code used to create the dataset for the League of Legends Analytics site Jung.GG, but permission is granted only to those with agreeable circumstances (recruiters/colleagues/friends) given my desire to keep our methods safe from competitors!

Current Portfolio:

Principle Component Analysis: Exploring techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the 2012 U.S. Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR-2). Using predominantly PCA, but a small comparission to the more complex techniques of UMAP and T-SNE is also performed.
